1. Open up a Unity scene of your choosing.

2. Create a Canvas (GameObject -> UI -> Canvas) game object into your scene's Hierarchy tab if there isn't one already.

3. In the Project tab, open the Prefabs folder (Assets -> Animated Crosshair Pack Vol. 1 -> Prefabs).

4. Open either the Markers folder or the Marker Combos folder.

4. Drag and drop any one of the prefabs onto the Canvas game object to make that that prefab is the canvas's child.

5. You should now see the crosshair on your game screen.

6. You can scale, rotate, and move the prefab whichever way you'd like.

7. If you select all of the prefab's children (prefab excluded), you can even change the color from white to anything else!

8. Click on the Play button in the Unity Editor to playtest your scene; the crosshair should be zooming in and out in a steady loop.
